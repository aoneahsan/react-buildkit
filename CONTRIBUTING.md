- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Ensure no TypeScript errors with `yarn build`

### Code Formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas in objects and arrays
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible

### File Organization

- Place new components in `src/packages/`
- Place new utilities in `src/utils/helpers/`
- Place new types in `src/types/`
- Place new enums in `src/enums/`

## Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commits for clear commit history:

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```
feat(storage): add support for session storage

Add a new option to use session storage instead of local storage
for temporary data that should not persist across sessions.

The previous regex was not accepting valid emails with + symbols.
This fix updates the regex to properly validate all RFC-compliant
email addresses.
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: If you've added new features, update the README.md and API documentation.

2. **Add Tests**: Ensure your changes are covered by tests. We aim for high test coverage.

3. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Add a note about your changes under the "Unreleased" section.

4. **Pass All Checks**: Ensure all tests pass and the build succeeds:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   yarn build
   ```

5. **Request Review**: Once your PR is ready, request a review from maintainers.

6. **Address Feedback**: Be responsive to feedback and make requested changes.

yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch

# Run tests for a specific file
yarn test path/to/file.test.ts
